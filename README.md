# Basic ML for rotten and fresh apple clasiffication

This project demonstrates basic machine learning for rotten and fresh apple classification by detect the ROI of each samples then extract the feature ( Color Histogram -> GLCM -> HOG ).
SVM, Random Forest and Logistic Regression are the ML model for classification

## Preprocessing
